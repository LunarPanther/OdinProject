            A grilled cheese sandwich is a simple yet satisfying classic. Itâ€™s
            perfect for a quick lunch, snack, or even a light dinner. The
            combination of crispy, buttery bread with melted cheese inside makes
            for a comforting and delicious treat. You can make it in under 10
            minutes with just a few basic ingredients: bread, cheese, and
            butter. This sandwich can also be customized by adding extras like
            tomatoes, ham, or bacon for a more gourmet experience.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread</li>
            <li>2 slices of cheese</li>
            <li>Butter(softened, for easy spreading)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Butter one side of each slice of bread generously. This will
                give the bread a golden, crispy exterior when grilled.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place two slices of cheese between the unbuttered sides of the
                bread.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat</li>
            <li>
                Place the sandwich in the skillet, buttered side down. Cook for
                about 2-3 minutes or until the bread turns golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip the sandwich carefully using a spatula, and cook the other
                side for another 2-3 minutes, until both sides are crispy and
                the cheese is fully melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the pan, slice in half, and enjoy while the cheese
                is still gooey!
            </li>
        </ol>
