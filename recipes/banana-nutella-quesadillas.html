        <p>
            The banana and Nutella wrap is a quick, no-cook snack or breakfast
            that kids and adults love alike. It’s perfect when you’re in a rush
            but still want something indulgent. The creamy Nutella, combined
            with the natural sweetness of the banana, makes for a delicious and
            easy treat. The tortilla wrap holds everything together, and it’s
            portable, making it great for on-the-go meals or snacks. You can add
            a sprinkle of granola or chopped nuts for some extra crunch.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium-sized tortilla wrap</li>
            <li>1 banana(ripe, but not too soft)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of Nutella(hazelnut spread)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Lay the tortilla flat on a plate and spread the Nutella evenly
                across the surface. You can adjust the amount based on your
                preference for sweetness.
            </li>
            <li>Peel the banana and place it in the center of the tortilla.</li>
            <li>
                Roll the tortilla around the banana like a burrito, tucking in
                the ends to prevent the filling from spilling out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice the wrap in half or into smaller rounds for easier eating,
                especially for kids.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately for a sweet, satisfying snack, or pack it for
                later!
            </li>
        </ol>
