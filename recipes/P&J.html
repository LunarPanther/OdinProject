            The peanut butter and jelly sandwich, often referred to as PB&J, is
            a timeless favorite, especially for those looking for a quick and
            filling meal. This sandwich combines the creamy richness of peanut
            butter with the sweet, fruity taste of jelly or jam, all held
            together by slices of soft or toasted bread. Itâ€™s versatile, easy to
            make, and perfect for breakfast, lunch, or a snack. With just a few
            basic ingredients, you can prepare a satisfying sandwich in minutes.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread</li>
            <li>Peanut butter</li>
            <li>Jelly or jam</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Toast the bread (optional): Start by toasting the slices of
                bread in a toaster, if you prefer a slightly crispy texture.
                Otherwise, you can leave the bread untoasted for a softer
                sandwich.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the peanut butter: Take one slice of bread and spread a
                generous layer of peanut butter on it. The amount can be
                adjusted based on your preference. Smooth peanut butter will
                give a creamy texture, while crunchy peanut butter will add a
                bit of bite.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the jelly or jam: On top of the peanut butter, spread a
                layer of jelly or jam. Make sure the jelly complements the
                peanut butter. Grape and strawberry are classic choices, but
                feel free to experiment with other flavors like raspberry or
                apricot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Close the sandwich: Place the second slice of bread on top of
                the peanut butter and jelly, creating a simple but delicious
                sandwich.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut and serve: You can cut the sandwich in half, either
                diagonally or into squares, depending on your preference.
            </li>
        </ol>
